Abstract:
Mathematically, a fourier series is used to convert a piecewaise continuous periodic function into a infinite summation of a combination of sin and cos functions as well as one constant value.
Fourier series are used almost everywhere from image analysis, image filtering, optics, signal processing, quantum mechanics, econometrics, shell theory etc.
The objective of our project is to use fourier series to remove background noise from an audio file. We will be providing two audio files, one with the actual audio from which the background noise is to be removed and the second which will be a blank audio recording with only the background noise. The code will use fourier transform to find the composite waves in both series, remove the common waves present and finally add up all remaining waves to give a noise cancelled audio as an output.
