Abstract:
An Audio Spectrum Analyzer application that is
used to see the frequency response of the voice of the speaker that it speaks in real-time. This application starts with the creation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function, which calculates the amplitude value of the captured audio sound that the user speaks. This Spectrum
Analyzer application was developed using the Guide User Interface (GUI) feature. Inputs
are processed in the form of sound signals captured by an microphone of the userâ€™s computer or inbuilt-laptop microphone and displayed in the software in the form of Sinusoidal waves. From the test results and comparison of the Audio Spectrum Analyzer application, it can be concluded that this device can also show the exact location of the spectrum..
