Abstract
Mathematically, the Laplace transform is an integral that converts a function of a real variable (often time) to a function of a complex variable (complex frequency).
Laplace Transform has a wide range of applications in the domains of engineering. 
The objective is to implement a Laplace calculator that will transform the difficult differential equations into simple problems 
in the Laplace domain, where solutions can be easily obtained. The Laplace calculator will try to find the Laplace transform of the given function. After entering the function, the user will get the complete solution step by step, so it will be better to understand it.
It makes the calculations faster and the integral change is displayed in a fraction of seconds." Laplace Transform Calculator " Application (build by using Python) will help future engineers to calculate basic problems so they can save time while solving bigger and complex Laplace equations.
